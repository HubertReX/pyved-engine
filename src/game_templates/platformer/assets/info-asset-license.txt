Assets come from a browser game called 
 "Wizard With Cane In Purple Mantle Goes On Journey"
 that is freely available on the web.

 I know for sure that some assets in the game are copyright free
but cannot remember which ones. Maybe some are copyrighted but I cannot find the information by myself for the moment( because the 
"Wizard With Cane In Purple Mantle Goes On Journey" does not display Credits, author info!)

so use this with care or simply replace assets with your own.

If you find more information about the License for these assets or if you recognize
your own work, please email me:  contact@kata.games
I am very interested.

Thank you for the help <3
