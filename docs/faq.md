## Misc

#### -Q. who created this tool?

Thomas "wkta" Iwaszko,

with a great contribution from Pierre Quentel who has designed the Brython (project foundations).

If you wish to contact me directly you can find my e-mail somewhere in code comments,
on [my github profile](https://github.com/wkta), or DM me via Discord: `IW.Tom#7412`

#### -Q. why is this tool not 100% free/ open-source?

The amount of work required to create such a tool seems to go beyond what a reasonable human being would accomplish for free

(1200+ hours of work to find a working architecture, implementing features and software components one by one using 3 different programming languages).

Contrary to pygame it has not been developed by a team, and has been developed over a short period of time (Pygame has 20+ years).

Most important: this tool has been created *first and foremost to foster the growth of the new * [Kata.games platform](https://kata.games). Every planned upgrade goes in that direction.
