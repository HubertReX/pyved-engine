# Share your games

Our team is currently working on an experimental feature that will empower you to easily share and distribute your indie game based on "PYV", with one single command.

In the near future, typing the command:
```
pyv-cli share myGame
```


â€¦Will upload your game to a server automatically and provide you with a link that you can share with friends.

And the result will look like this:
