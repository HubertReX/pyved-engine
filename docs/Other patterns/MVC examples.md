MVC, or Model-View-Controller, is a foundational architectural pattern
that has long been a cornerstone in software development. It divides an application
into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. Much like separate
pieces of a well-organized puzzle, these components work in harmony
to create a structured and efficient software system.
